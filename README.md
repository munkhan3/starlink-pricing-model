# ðŸŒŒ Starlink Regional Pricing Optimization â€” Nevada, Nebraska, and Iowa

### Objective
Determine the **optimal residential pricing strategy** for Starlink service across **Nevada, Nebraska, and Iowa** to **maximize customer adoption** while **maintaining average revenue per user (ARPU)**.

This project uses **publicly available data** to model broadband competition, identify underserved markets, and estimate the adoption response to different pricing tiers.

## ðŸ§­ Project Overview

| Stage | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **1. Problem Definition** | Define objective, constraints, and KPIs â€” maximize adoption while preserving ARPU. |
| **2. Data Collection** | Pull public data (FCC Broadband Map, ACS Census API, BroadbandNow, Ookla) for the three states. |
| **3. Exploratory Analysis** | Assess competition, coverage gaps, demographics, and rurality via visualizations. |
| **4. Modeling** | Estimate adoption response (logit model) and solve for prices that meet the ARPU constraint. |
| **5. Optimization** | Run grid search / solver to identify price levels maximizing adoption given ARPU bounds. |
| **6. Results & Insights** | Visualize adoption vs. price trade-offs and present pricing recommendations. |

## Methodology

1. **Data Aggregation**
   - Merge county-level FCC and ACS data to identify underserved households.
   - Derive key variables: provider count, median income, population density, % rural, and internet subscription rate.

2. **Modeling Adoption**
   - Estimate potential adoption share using a **logit demand model** with **price**, **income**, and **competition** features.
   - Calibrate elasticity to match broadband studies (baseline âˆ’0.45).

3. **Optimization**
   - Maximize total projected adoption `Î£ adoption(price) Ã— households`
   - Subject to ARPU â‰¥ baseline constraint.
   - Perform state-level and two-tier (Lite / Residential) scenarios.

4. **Scenario Analysis**
   - Simulate impact of discounting in low-competition counties.
   - Visualize adoption curves and priceâ€“ARPU trade-offs.

---

## Brief Results Overview
- **Optimal price bands** by state and service tier.  
- **Projected adoption uplift** vs. current pricing.  
- **ARPU trade-off analysis** showing feasible price corridors.  
- **Policy & expansion implications** â€” where lower pricing yields the strongest ROI on coverage.

---

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- Integrate tract-level granularity to improve rural targeting.  
- Add sensitivity analysis for different elasticity priors (âˆ’0.3 to âˆ’0.7).  
- Simulate multi-tier regional pricing (e.g., metro vs. rural discounting).  
- Extend to neighboring states for cross-border adoption spillovers.
